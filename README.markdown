PKGBUILD for context-minimals
=============================

The ConTeXt Minimal <http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Minimals> is
a complete, up-to-date ConTeXt distribution which can be upgraded
efficiently. It can be used to install either the stable or the beta
version of ConTeXt. It can also be used in parallel with existing TeX
installtions such as MikTeX, TeXLive, or older minimal installation. It
is aimed towards ConTeXt users, so it does not include LaTeX specific
packages and binaries.

This PKGBUILD installs the ConTeXt related files at 

    /opt/context-minimals

To use the minimals distribution, you need to run

    source /opt/context-minimals/setuptex

in the shell from which you want to invoke context. After sourcing
setuptex, you can run ConTeXt mkII using

    texexec filename

To run mkIV for the first time, you need to run 

    luatools --generate

a normal user (*and not as root*). You need to rerun this command as a
normal user each time you upgrade.

All bugs can be reported at the ConTeXt mailing list
